      <h4>The Couple</h4>
      <p>In 2012, Jeffrey and Elyse sat at the same lunch table at a web design and development conference. Jeffrey did not speak the entire meal. Elyse does not remember this.</p>

      <p>A year later, Jeffrey did a much better job of making himself known. At an Austin web community afterparty, he performed a heartfelt karaoke rendition of “Nights in White Satin,” by the Moody Blues. Elyse, who has Moody Blues lyrics tattooed on her arm, greeted Jeffrey as he left the stage with a hug and “We’re going to be friends.” Yes they would.</p>

      <p>Their first date started with dinner at a French restaurant and ended in the wee hours of the morning with cocktails at a speakeasy. The subsequent months included music festivals, a company prom, and a magical New Year’s trip to Marfa.</p>

      <p>In January 2015, Jeffrey asked Elyse to marry him. There were glasses of champagne, logs burning in the fireplace, and tears of joy. It was perfect.</p>

      <p>These days, the happy couple lives and works in downtown Austin, travels as much as they can, and can frequently be found at the same French restaurant where they went on their first date.</p>

      <h5>Elyse</h5>
      <h6>As told by Jeffrey</h6>
      <p>Jeffrey’s mother’s first question about Elyse was “Is she smart?” “Yes.” After finishing high school a couple years early, the Alabama-raised Elyse earned a graphic design degree at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute. Her career brought her to Austin in 2009, and she’s become a leader among front-end web developers. Elyse regularly speaks at developer conferences, and recently took up organizing them as well. In her day job, she builds tools for other software engineers to use at RetailMeNot.</p>
      
      <p>Jeffrey loves how many novels Elyse goes through in a week, and his stomach has benefited (or at least, expanded) from her delicious culinary experiments. Her other interests include wine, dachshunds, and only occasionally groaning at Jeffrey’s puns.</p>
