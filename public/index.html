        <p>Honestly, the best wedding gift you can give is to spend the weekend with us in Austin. We know it will take effort, and it won&#8217;t go unappreciated.</p>

        <h5>Travel fund</h5>
        <p>We love traveling more than things. If you&#8217;d like to help make our post-wedding adventure extra special, feel free to give to our <a href="https://www.zola.com/registry/collection-item/5660ed54e4b06538de69e823">honeymoon fund</a>.</p>

        <h5>Things for our home</h5>
        <p>A one-bedroom urban apartment fills up quick, so we honestly don&#8217;t need a lot of stuff. But if gift-giving is your jam, here are <a href="https://www.zola.com/registry/jeffreyandelyse">a few things we&#8217;d love to have in our home</a>.</p>

				<h5>Can I bring a Plus One?</h5>
				<p><em>“I’m the Doctor, this is Rose Tyler. She’s my ‘plus one.’ Is that all right?”</em></p>
				<p>Yes, of course! Plus Ones are more than welcome, as long as they're ready to party, dance, smile, and celebrate.</p>

				<h5>Can I bring my kids?</h5>
				<p>This one's up to you. While our venue does allow children, it is a bar, and our party doesn't start until 8pm. We don't have any special activities for children planned, so if they're very young, they might be better off at home.</p>

				<h5>Will there be dinner?</h5>
				<p>No, there will be no sit-down dinner: we're skipping the boring part and going straight to the party! We'll have light snacks and desserts all night, but if you plan to drink, plan to eat dinner beforehand.</p>

				<h5>How do I get there?</h5>
				<p>The Belmont is located between Guadalupe and Lavaca Streets on 6th Street.</p>

				<p>We strongly encourage you to use alternate transportation: take <a href="http://uber.com">Uber</a>, <a href="http://lyft.com">Lyft</a>, use car2go, take a pedicab, or if you're staying close by, walk! Please be safe, particularly if you plan to drink. (If you need a new user code for Lyft or Uber, let Jeffrey or Elyse know!)</p>

				<p>There is very limited parking at the Belmont. They do have a valet for $10. You can also park at the Chase parking garage off 5th between Lavaca and Colorado or in the surface lot in the old Post Office. More information about parking can be found at <a href="http://www.downtownaustin.com/experience/parking">downtownaustin.com/experience/parking</a>.</p>

				<h5>What should I wear?</h5>
				<p>Short answer: cocktail attire.</p>
				<p>Long answer: For men, a casual suit, slacks and a blazer. For women, a cocktail/short dress or casual maxi dress, or similar. Leave the jeans at home—let's get fancy!</p>
				<p>Don't forget your dancing shoes! Rubber-soled shoes hinder your moves, so if you want to get down, make sure you've got leather-soled shoes that are comfortable to dance in!</p>

				<h5>Do I have to bring you a card or gift?</h5>
				<p>If you want to get us a gift, <a href="#gifts">you can find more info about that here</a>, but really, we're good, and we'd prefer if you sent them to use later instead of brought them to the party.</p>


				<h5>Wait, there's no ceremony?</h5>
				<p>We're having an intimate ceremony on Friday with our families. We wanted it to be small and personal... but we also wanted to celebrate with all our friends. We'll do a great big champagne toast and dance all night instead! </p>


				<h5>Help! I don't know how to salsa!</h5>
				<p>So? It's a wedding, nobody's judging you. We love you and your moves!</p>

            <p>In 2012, Jeffrey and Elyse sat at the same lunch table at a web design and development conference. Jeffrey did not speak the entire meal. Elyse does not remember this.</p>

            <p>A year later, Jeffrey did a much better job of making himself known. At an Austin web meetup after-party, he performed a heartfelt karaoke rendition of <em>Nights in White Satin</em>, by the Moody Blues. Elyse, who has Moody Blues lyrics tattooed on her arm, greeted Jeffrey as he left the stage with a hug and &ldquo;We&#8217;re going to be friends!&rdquo;</p>

            <p class="about-us-callout">Ask Elyse about it some time. You&#8217;ll get a lively re-enactment and a very big hug.</p>

            <p>Their first date started with dinner at a French restaurant and ended in the wee hours of the morning with cocktails at a speakeasy. The subsequent months included music festivals, a company prom, and a magical New Year’s trip to Marfa.</p>

            <p>In January 2015, Jeffrey asked Elyse to marry him. There were glasses of champagne, logs burning in the fireplace, and tears of joy. It was perfect.</p>

            <p>These days, the happy couple lives and works in downtown Austin, travels as much as they can, and can frequently be found dancing in their living room.</p>
