            <p>If you have time, explore the area. Stay a few extra days. Use our wedding as an excuse to take a vacation. Austin is as cool as every Internet listicle claims. Here are some of our favorites.</p>

            <h5>Lady Bird Johnson Wildflower Center</h5>
            <h6>http://www.wildflower.org</h6>
            <p>Lady Bird loved the Central Texas landscape, and there's no better time of year to enjoy it. This place is why you have an Austin wedding in April. Go get your fill of bluebonnets, Indian paintbrushes, and sunshine.</p>

            <h5>Explore South Congress</h5>
            <h6>Between Oltorf and E. Riverside</h6>
            <p>This strip of S. Congress Ave. is a great way to kill an afternoon. Try on some cowboy boots, shop bizarre antique stores, and snack on some Amy's Mexican Vanilla ice cream. The best burgers and pizza in the city are right there too.</p>
